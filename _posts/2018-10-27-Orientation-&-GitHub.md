During the workshop, participants learned the basics of GIT, understand the Git Flow, created a sample repository to play with and made their first pull request.
First, they got an overview of how the workflow of producing software works in IT companies. The about Git that Git is a version control system, which tracks versions of the project over time and most of its commands. We also worked with GitHub to gain an understanding of how to fork, clone, and contribute to projects by submitting pull requests.

The total number of attendees was more than 80.
